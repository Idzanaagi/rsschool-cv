## Code examples
Description KATA from Codewars: Given two numbers and an arithmetic operator (the name of it, as a string), return the result of the two numbers having that operator used on them. a and b will both be positive integers, and a will always be the first number in the operation, and b always the second. The four operators are "add", "subtract", "divide", "multiply". 

```javascript
function arithmetic(a, b, operator){
  let result = (operator === "add") ? a + b : (operator === "subtract") ? a - b : (operator === "multiply") ? a * b : a / b;
  return result;
}
```

## Work experience

[Days without incident](https://github.com/Idzanaagi/daysWithoutIncident) – The main goal (apart from practical use) was to consolidate the skills already acquired. At the same time, I figured out the formatting and conversion of dates in JS. There are plans to expand the functionality (for example, add parallel maintenance of several calculations), cover it with tests. Used fs, ESLint, readline-sync.

[Difference Calculator](https://github.com/Idzanaagi/frontend-project-lvl2) – allows you to compare two configuration files (with json, yaml or yml extension). Second study project. Of the requirements - development through testing, continuous integration, the utility must work with both relative and absolute paths. Used CLI Builder (commander.js), fs (node,js), lodash, test coverage. Practiced working with json, yaml formats and recursion.

[Mind games](https://github.com/Idzanaagi/frontend-project-lvl1) – 5 math games to warm up your brain. It's my first study project. Of the requirements – modular approach, the use of abstractions and pure functions, code compliance with the Airbnb standard. Worked with npm, makefile, readline-sync. The main thing that this project gave me was an understanding of how to build an architecture (in this case, launching games) so that this logic is in one place.
